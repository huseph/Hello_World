Hello World!

MANY YEARS LATER as he faced the dalaos from JoTang, Huseph was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to have his first program Hello_World.cpp. 

I'm luckily and honorly get into UESTC to study in programing and make acquiantance of Cao, my peer leader, who works in JoTang studio.
To get the opportunity to take part in the studio, I signed up my GitHub account and to learn about programing.
